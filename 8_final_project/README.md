For my final project, I decided to create a portfolio of computational poems I have been creating for another class I am currently taking, *Reading and Writing Electronic Texts*.

What is computational poetry? Computational poetry is an emerging artistic form that, as the name implies, combines computers and language to create poetry. Computational poetry can be very beautiful. It can be very confusing. It can be upsetting. However, what I appreciate most, is the capability it has to juxtapose objects, ideas, and people against one another in ways that may never have been otherwise.

Linked here you will find both my initial prototype and final project, along with links to a live running versions of the sites.

Summary of technologies used:
- HTML + CSS
- SVG
- JavaScript/jQuery
- HTML Canvas
- WebGL via three.js
- Python via a mini Flask server (for generating poems on the fly)
