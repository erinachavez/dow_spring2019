For part 1 of this assignment, I updated a CSS animation from a [previous assignment](https://github.com/erinachavez/dow_spring2019/tree/master/3_css_animation), and utilized JavaScript for a better user experience.

**Part 2**

With part 2, I was tasked with creating a JavaScript animation that was thematically related to part 1. Thus, I worked with the requestAnimationFrame method to create a linear version of my zoetrope.
