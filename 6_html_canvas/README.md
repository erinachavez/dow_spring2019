A little stumped on ideas for this assignment, I was browsing my photo library for images that I could potentially work with for this assignment. When I saw the photo of this cat,

<img src="https://github.com/erinachavez/dow_spring2019/blob/master/6_html_canvas/cat.jpg" alt="" width="200" />

I couldn't help but have fun and manipulate it. Thus I drew custom SVG drawings of his hat and sunglasses, and played with the imageData of the original image to create the animation I did.
